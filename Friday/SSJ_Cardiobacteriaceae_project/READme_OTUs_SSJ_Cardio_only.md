##Cardiobacteriaceae Project SSJ

Within SSJ group samples, 32 OTUs are grouped into three taxonomic groups within family Cardiobacteriaceae. 31 of those OTUs are rare and don't display significant relationships with samples. The remaining single OTU within that family shows strong trends with specific samples. That OTU shares no greater than 92% sequence identity at that 16S locus with any other OTU identified in taxonomic databases and can be identified only at the family level. The .fasta file for the representative (centroid) of that OTU is included as OTU898.fna.
